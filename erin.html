The movie is based on the true story of Erin Brockovich, who helped residents of Hinkley, California, file a lawsuit against Pacific Gas &amp; Electric (PG&amp;E) for contaminating their water supply with hexavalent chromium, a toxic chemical. Brockovich, a single mother and legal assistant, discovered the contamination while investigating a suspicious real estate case involving PG&amp;E. She spoke out against PG&amp;E and helped build a case against them, eventually leading to a $333 million settlement for the residents of Hinkley. The movie portrays Brockovich&#39;s struggles as a single mother and her determination to seek justice for the residents of Hinkley. By sharing her personal experiences and investigating the contamination, Brockovich brought attention to the issue and held PG&amp;E accountable for its actions. The movie&#39;s success helped bring further attention to environmental pollution and the importance of holding corporations responsible for their actions.</span></p><h3 class="c3" id="h.al89yllof4he"><span class="c0 c6">Q2. What motivated Erin to investigate the case of PG&amp;E?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ans</span><span class="c5">. Erin Brockovich became motivated to investigate the case of PG&amp;E after noticing an unusual illness pattern in the small town of Hinkley, California. As a legal clerk for Masry &amp; Vititoe, she was asked to investigate a real estate case in the area. While there, she noticed that many residents were experiencing chronic health problems, such as asthma, nosebleeds, and rashes. She began to ask questions and discovered that PG&amp;E had contaminated the town&#39;s water supply with the toxic chemical chromium6. Brockovich&#39;s investigation ultimately led to a successful lawsuit against PG&amp;E, which resulted in a $333 million settlement for over600 plaintiffs. The case was settled in1996 and was the largest ever paid in a direct-action lawsuit at the time. The story of Brockovich&#39;s involvement in the case was the subject of the2000 film &quot;Erin Brockovich,&quot; which starred Julia Roberts in the title role. The film was a critical and commercial success, earning more than $250 million worldwide and receiving multiple Academy Award nominations. Since the settlement, Brockovich has continued to work as a consumer advocate and environmental activist. She has been involved in numerous successful lawsuits against environmental polluters as well as ongoing lawsuits involving automobiles, pharmaceuticals, and medical devices. She is the president of Brockovich Research &amp; Consulting and in partnership with Google curates a crowd-sourced map intended to track possible environmental health hazards around the world.</span></p><h3 class="c3" id="h.j7fmcvr1ww6v"><span class="c6 c0">Q3.How did she gain trust of the Hinkley residents?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ans</span><span class="c5">. Erin Brockovich gained the trust of the Hinkley residents through her dedicated efforts in investigating and exposing the contamination of their water supply by Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company (PG&amp;E). After being hired by Ed Masry as a file clerk, Erin discovered medical records in a real estate file that led her to investigate the groundwater contamination in Hinkley with carcinogenic hexavalent chromium. She visited Hinkley residents to gain their trust and to uncover additional evidence to build a case against PG&amp;E. Erin held a barbecue to speak to many of the residents and explain to them what PG&amp;E has been trying to get away with. Over time, she found numerous medical problems in Hinkley and that virtually everyone has been treated by PG&amp;E&#39;s doctors, who have led them to believe their issues are unrelated to the &quot;safe&quot; chromium. However, Erin faced obstacles in her investigation, including being fired for missing a week of work and having to pursue binding arbitration rather than a trial by jury to settle the case. She gained the residents&#39; trust by listening to their stories and empathizing with their struggles. Erin also gained their trust by providing the evidence she uncovered and holding town hall meetings to explain the situation to them. Through her dedication to the case, Erin successfully built a case against PG&amp;E, leading to a $333 million settlement for the Hinkley residents. Even after the settlement, Erin continued to fight for access to safe water and became a media personality, hosting TV series and working as a consultant for law firms focused on personal injury claims for asbestos exposure.</span></p><h3 class="c3" id="h.990tku5madmz"><span class="c6 c0">Q4. Why did she not want to give up the case?</span></h3><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ans</span><span class="c5">. Erin Brockovich did not want to give up the case because she had discovered that the Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Company (PG&amp;E) was contaminating the groundwater in Hinkley, California. She had found medical records in real estate files that led her to believe that PG&amp;E was dumping hexavalent chromium, a toxic waste, in the area, causing the residents&#39; illnesses. Erin was convinced that the facts did not add up, and she started investigating the case further. She discovered a systematic cover-up of the industrial poisoning of the city&#39;s water supply, which threatened the entire community&#39;s health. Erin was determined to pursue legal proceedings against PG&amp;E, even though it seemed beyond the capabilities of the small law firm she worked at. She made her boss, Ed Masry, as passionate about the case as she was, and he took it on. Erin and Ed had to make great sacrifices in their lives, with the legal costs spreading Ed very thin and the round-the-clock work taking Erin out of touch with her boyfriend and her kids. Despite these challenges, Erin persevered because she believed in the cause and was determined to hold PG&amp;E accountable for its actions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c5"></span></p></body></html>
